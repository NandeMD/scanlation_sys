# Scanlation SYSTEM

A system developed to help scanlation teams organize and streamline their work efficiently with a Discord bot.

# Features
* The backbone of the entire system, an [API](https://github.com/NandeMD/scanlation_sys/tree/main/scan_api) responsible for communicating with databases and coordinating all aspects of the system.
* A [simple website](https://github.com/NandeMD/scanlation_sys/tree/main/website) for providing database entries, adding series, adding chapters, deleting, and visualizing data.
* A [simple updater script](https://github.com/NandeMD/scanlation_sys/tree/main/update_script) to update all of your series and database entries.
* A [bot](https://github.com/NandeMD/scanlation_sys/tree/main/discord_bot) created to manage the entire team's operations through Discord. With this bot, tracking your team's tasks will become much easier.
